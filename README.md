### Updating CV Content

Each file contains structured data for:
- Personal information and summary
- Work experience

- Social media links

### Adding Projects

Projects are managed through:
- `project-whitelist.json` - Controls which projects are displayed

### Styling

Global styles are defined in `src/style.scss`. Component-specific styles use scoped CSS within each Vue component.

## 🌍 Multi-language Support

The application supports both English and Swedish languages. Language switching is handled by the `LangSelector` component, which loads the appropriate content file based on user selection.
